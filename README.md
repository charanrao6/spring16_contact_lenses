3. Are the contact lenses long lasting?


# MODELS AND ANALYSIS

What models did you use to process your data and perform the analysis of your research questions?  

Describe your methods and how you applied your models to the data.  


# CODE AND APPLICATION

For your application you will be writing code.  Please make sure your group:

- provides the Github link to your code,
- provides detailed instructions on how to compile and deploy your code,
- provides any special instructions for running your code and/or applying data to see the results.

The code needs to be Github and instructions on installation are in the README.md file at the root level.

# PROJECT MANAGEMENT

The Group has three people they are Ruthvik Reddy Gidde,Chandra Charan Saineni and Jyothsna Sappid.Chandra charan will be dealing with the data analysis and testing part, Ruthik will build scripts and Jyothsna will be helping with implementation and data analysis.

You will also provide details about the project deliverables and milestones.  These example tables should be used as a guide.

# PROJECT TEAM, DELIVERABLES AND CHECKPOINTS
These tables show examples of the data that should go into each column and row.


## TEAM

| Team member | Roles and skills | Contributions |
|-------------|-------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| Ruthvik Reddy Gidde| build scripts |  |
| Chandra Charan Saineni | data analysis and testing  | -- |
| Jyothsna Sappid | data analysis and implementation | -- |

## DELIVERABLES AND CHECKPOINTS

The deliverable and checkpoints will be iteratively completed.  At the end of the project, there should be a fair amount of content these tables that details the who, what and when of your project.  Don't worry if you don't have all the deliverables sketched out -- this is a LIVING table, and should be updated frequently by all team members involved in the project.

| Checkpoint date | Expected Deliverable                                                          | Responsible team member(s) | Checkpoint results                                                                                                                  |
|---------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|WHEN | What will be delivered?  These should be small enough tasks to complete in the time given and large enough to represent some complexity. | Who will delivery this?    | WHAT WERE THE RESULTS?  FILL THIS IN AFTER THE CHECKPOINT HAS PASSED! |
